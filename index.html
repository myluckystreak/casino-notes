    <!-- OPENING -->
    <section>
      <p>I’ve played at a handful of online casinos in Australia over the years. I usually just sign up and claim the free bonuses and if I win money from them, then great! However, what I learned pretty quickly is that a lot of them are fun to play on, but no good when it comes to payouts.</p>

      <p>In my experience, many casinos don't allow withdrawals to Australian bank accounts, or they make the process to withdraw extremely difficult. I try not to get my hopes up now when I win, until the money hits my bank account.</p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Out of all the casinos I’ve tried, only two have actually followed through and paid me without issues.</strong>

    <!-- NEOSPIN -->
    <section>
      <h2>Neospin <span class="tag">$2,300 won and withdrawn</span></h2>

      </a>

      <p>One of the sites that worked for me was Neospin. I mainly signed up because they had free spins with no deposit, and a massive pokies section (3,000+ games), which is mostly what I play anyway. There were heaps of slots to choose from: different themes, volatility levels, and plenty with free spins, multipliers, and bonus buy features.</p>

      </a>

      <p>I played over a few sessions and honestly just got lucky. One of the pokies bonus rounds hit nicely, then another one followed not long after. Those features are really what kept things going. Free spins re-triggering, extra wilds dropping in, multipliers stacking. Before I realised it, I was sitting at just over $2,300!</p>

      <p>When I went to withdraw, they asked for ID and payment verification, which is pretty standard. I sent everything through and waited, half-expecting them to reject my withdrawal like some other casinos. Instead, a few days later the money was in my bank account!</p>

      <p>This is the official website:

    <!-- CROWNSLOTS -->
    <section>
      <h2>Crownslots <span class="tag">$1,600 won and withdrawn</span></h2>

      </a>

      <p>The other site that actually paid me was Crownslots. I don't usually play table games, but I noticed they had a live casino section, which is really cool. They have an actual dealer (a person, not a computer) who is streamed to you in real time, so you know that the games aren't rigged. I was playing blackjack and had a decent run, I was actually up about $3,500 at one point! But I got greedy and donated some of it back to the casino. Ended up with $1,600 profit and I thought I better stop while I was still ahead.</p>

      </a>

      <p>Crownslots also has a big pokies section (about 8,000 games), and I did spend some time there as well. Similar story to Neospin, there are tons of slots with bonus features, free spins, and different mechanics that at least give you chances to build a win instead of just spinning dead reels over and over. I didn't manage to win more on the slots, I was up and down for a bit, but still hovering around $1,600 so I decided to cash out.</p>

      <p>I requested the withdrawal. The verification process was easy and didn’t feel over the top. The withdrawal was processed and the money arrived without any issues.</p>

      <h2>Why I’m Pointing These Two Casinos Out</h2>

      <p>I’m not saying these are the best casinos out there, or that you’ll always win. Most of the time you won’t, that’s just how gambling works and the house always has the edge. I’m only speaking from my own experience.</p>

      <p>But what I am saying is that out of all the online casinos I’ve <strong><a href="https://t.me/systemicconfirmationausbot?start=w31532735">personally</a>a</strong> tried in Australia, these are the only two that actually paid me when I withdrew. If I play, I want to know that if I do get lucky, I can actually get my money out.</p>
